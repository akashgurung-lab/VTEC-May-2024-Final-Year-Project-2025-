Mid-Latitude Ionospheric VTEC Response to the Severe G5 Geomagnetic Storm of May 2024


## üåå Overview
Welcome to the official repository for the research project, "A Study of Mid-Latitude Ionospheric VTEC Response to the Severe Geomagnetic Storm of May 2024". This project investigates the ionospheric disturbances triggered by the historic G5-level geomagnetic storm of May 10-12, 2024, one of the most intense space weather events in over two decades. By analyzing data from a global network of nine mid-latitude GNSS stations, this study reveals the dramatic impacts of solar wind-driven phenomena on the Earth's ionosphere.
The codebase provides a comprehensive Python-based pipeline for processing raw GNSS data, calculating Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC), and visualizing the ionospheric response through publication-quality plots. Key findings include:

Massive Positive Storm Phase: Dayside VTEC enhancements exceeding 700% above quiet-day levels, driven by Prompt Penetration Electric Fields (PPEFs).
Prolonged Negative Storm Phase: Widespread VTEC depletions reaching -80%, associated with the Disturbance Dynamo Electric Field (DDEF).
Spatio-Temporal Evolution: Detailed insights into the dynamic ionospheric behavior across different geographical longitudes.

This repository is designed for researchers, space weather enthusiasts, and data scientists interested in ionospheric physics and geomagnetic storm impacts. We invite you to explore, adapt, and extend this codebase to further unravel the complexities of this extraordinary event.
üõ∞Ô∏è Features

Data Processing: Scripts to parse, clean, and merge multi-day, multi-station GNSS data in .Cmn format.
VTEC Calculation: Processes output from the GOPI SEEMALA GPS-TEC analysis program to derive VTEC for scientific analysis.
Quantitative Analysis: Computes percentage deviation of VTEC (dTEC) to quantify ionospheric disturbances relative to a quiet-day baseline.
Correlation Analysis: Aligns ionospheric data with solar wind parameters (IMF $B_z$, $V_{sw}$, $P_{sw}$) and geomagnetic indices (SYM-H) to reveal cause-and-effect relationships.
Publication-Quality Visualizations: Generates high-quality, multi-panel plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:
Global GNSS station distribution map.
Solar wind and geomagnetic conditions.
Quiet-day VTEC behavior.
Storm and recovery phase VTEC analysis.
Comprehensive dTEC variation plots.



üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the scripts, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
cartopy

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/akashgurung-lab/VTEC-May-2024-Final-Year-Project-2025-.git
cd VTEC-May-2024-Final-Year-Project-2025-


Install the required dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn cartopy



Data Requirements
The scripts expect specific data formats and directory structures:

GNSS Data: Daily station data in .Cmn format, generated by the GOPI SEEMALA GPS-TEC analysis program from raw RINEX files. Store data in /STATIONS/[STATION_NAME]/[filename].Cmn.
Solar Wind & Geomagnetic Data: OMNI solar wind data and SYM-H indices, available from public space weather databases (e.g., NASA‚Äôs OMNIWeb).

Ensure data is placed in the appropriate directories as referenced in the scripts.
‚öôÔ∏è Usage
The codebase is modular, with each script handling a specific aspect of the analysis. All scripts are well-documented with comments for ease of use. Below is an overview of the main scripts:

6.1_station_map.py: Creates a global map visualizing the distribution of GNSS stations.
6.2_solar_wind_plot.py: Plots solar wind parameters and SYM-H index to illustrate the storm‚Äôs drivers.
6.3_quiet_day_analysis.py: Analyzes VTEC data for quiet days (May 7-9) to establish a baseline.
6.4_storm_day_analysis.py: Visualizes VTEC during the storm phase (May 10-12).
6.5_recovery_phase_analysis.py: Examines VTEC during the recovery phase (May 13-15).
6.6_dTEC_calculation.py: Calculates dTEC and generates multi-station disturbance plots.

Run any script from the terminal:
python 6.6_dTEC_calculation.py
