# üõ∞Ô∏è A Study of Mid-Latitude Ionospheric VTEC Response to the Severe Geomagnetic Storm of May 2024

## üìú Abstract

This repository contains the complete analytical framework and thesis documentation for investigating the mid-latitude ionospheric response to the severe geomagnetic storm of May 10-12, 2024, using Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) data derived from a global network of nine ground-based GNSS stations. An analysis comparing VTEC variations during the storm with a baseline established from geomagnetically quiet days (May 7-9) is presented, and the ionospheric response is correlated with interplanetary data from the OMNIWeb service.

The storm was characterized by a sustained period of southward IMF Bz and a minimum SYM-H index of -497 nT, classifying it as a severe event. A major positive ionospheric storm was observed on a global scale, with the normal diurnal VTEC pattern being completely disrupted. During the storm's main phase, VTEC values showed a dramatic enhancement, with peaks at some stations exceeding 120 TECU, representing an increase of over 100% compared to the quiet day baseline.

**Note**: This repository serves as the computational component of the corresponding Bachelor's project work.

**Key Findings:**
- **Strong Local Time Dependence**: Stations on the dayside during the storm's onset exhibited prompt and intense VTEC enhancement consistent with Prompt Penetration Electric Fields (PPEFs), while stations on the nightside showed a more gradual and delayed response characteristic of the Disturbance Dynamo effect
- **Prolonged Recovery Phase**: VTEC patterns remained disturbed for several days, highlighting the long-lasting impact of the storm's energy input
- **Global Scale Response**: Complete disruption of normal diurnal VTEC patterns across the mid-latitude network
- **Cause-and-Effect Relationships**: Comprehensive characterization of solar wind drivers and the complex, geographically dependent response of the mid-latitude ionosphere

**Note**: This repository serves as the computational component of the corresponding Bachelor's project work. For detailed theoretical background, methodology, and comprehensive analysis, please refer to the complete thesis document.
